<h1>EAM Potentials (option eam)</h1>

<p>
The energy in potentials of the Embedded Atom type consitsts of two
parts, a pair potential term specifyed by the function Phi(r)
representing the electrostatic core-core repulsion, and a cohesive
term specifyed by the function F(rho) representing the energy the ion
core gets when it is "embedded" in the "Electron Sea". This Embedding 
Energy is a function of the local electron density, which in turn
is constructed as a superposition of contributions from neighboring 
atoms. This electron transfer is specifyed by the function Rho(r).</p>

<p> The embedding function F_i(rho) depends on the type of the
embedded atom, the transfer function Rho_j(r) depends on the type j of
the donating atom, whereas the pair potential Phi_ij(r) depends on the
types i and j of both atoms involved. All potential functions are
given in a single file, whose format is described above <a
href="potformat.html">above</a></p>

<p>
The Embedded Atom Method (EAM) for <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a> was
implemented by Erik Bitzek. It was adapted for use in <em>potfit</em>
by Peter Brommer.

The Embedded Atom Method was suggested by Daw and Baskes (M. S. Daw
and M. I. Baskes, <EM>Phys. Rev. B </EM><B>29</B>, 6443 (1984);
S. M. Foiles, M. I. Baskes, and M. S. Daw, <EM> Phys. Rev. B </EM>
<B>33</B>, 7983 (1986)) as a way to overcome the main 
<a href="http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~ercolessi/md/md/node47.html#SECTION00630000000000000000">
problem with two-body potentials</a>: the coordination independence of
the bond strength, while still being acceptable fast (about 2 times
slower than pair potentials).</p> 
<p>
Ideas from the Density Functional Theory 
or the Tight Binding formalism may lead to the following form for the 
total energy:</p>
<p>
E<sub>tot</sub> = &sum;<sub>i,j</sub><sup>N</sup> &Phi;<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>)   + &sum;<sub>i</sub><sup>N</sup> F(&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>)                <BR>
&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = &sum;<sub>j</sub>
&rho;<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) </p>
<p>
While an identification of the  pair potential term  &Phi;<sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) with
the electrostatic core-core repulsion, and of the cohesive term  
F(&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub>) with the energy the ion core
gets when it is "embedded" in the local electron density
&rho;<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> may be tempting, it is nevertheless
without physical justification. Due to invariance properties of the
EAM potential, a embedding energy term linear in the "electron"
density can be described by pair interactions, thus shifting
contributions between embedding and pair energy. So an isolated
consideration of either part is not possible - physical relevance
only lies in the combination of both. </p>

<p>
 The local electron density  
is constructed as a superposition of contributions
&rho;<sup>at</sup><sub>ij</sub>(r<sub>ij</sub>) from neighboring
atoms. </p>
<p>
Also belonging to this analytical form are models like the <EM>glue
model</EM>, and the <EM>Finnis-Sinclair potentials</EM>.
