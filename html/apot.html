<h1>Analytic Potentials</h1>

<p>
Analytic pair potentials can be enabled in <em>potfit</em> by compiling it with
the <b>apot</b> switch. There are some additional options for analytic potentials like the 
chemical potentials or the smooth cutoff.
</p>

<h2><a id="globals" name="globals">Global parameters</a></h2>
<p>
<em>potfit</em> supports global parameters, which can occur in different potentials. With this feature it is possible for any potential to "share" parameters with each other.
To use them, you need a section called "global n" after the header in your potential file, where n is the number of global parameters. The format for the parameters is the same as for normal parameters: name value min max.
<br>
If you want to use a global parameter in a potential, use the name of the global parameter and add an exclamation mark.

<h2><a id="sc" name="sc">
Smooth Cutoff</a></h2>
<p>
The smooth cutoff function is very important for analytic potentials since it ensures that the
potential and its gradient vanish at the desired cutoff radius.<br />
Therefor the potential is replaced by a cutoff function &Psi; at a certain range.<br />
<img src="cutoff.png" alt="E_tot=\sum_{species}\mu_iN_i+\sum_{pairs}V(r)" /> where <img src="cutoff-order.png" alt="E_tot=\sum_{species}\mu_iN_i+\sum_{pairs}V(r)" /><br />
To enable the smooth cutoff for a potential, _sc has to be added to the potential identifier.</p>
<pre>
type lj_sc
cutoff 7
epsilon 0.1 0 1
sigma 2.5 1 4
h 1 0 2
</pre>
<p>Potentials fitted with the _sc option will have an additional parameter h at the end. If you omit it, it will be kept fix at a value of 1.</p>
