<h1>Interactions</h1>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> supports various short range
effective potentials. These potentials are defined by tabulated
functions read from a <a href="potformat.html">potential file</a>.
The potentials supported are <a href="pairpot.html">central pair
potentials</a>, and
<a href="eam2.html">Embedded Atom Method (EAM)</a> potentials for 
metals.

<p>
Since the computation of the forces is the most time-critical part
of a molecular dynamics simulation, support for each type of
interaction has to be enabled explicitly by a compilation option.
If no interaction type is specified, central pair potentials
are assumed by default.
