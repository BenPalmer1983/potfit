<h1>Compiling</h1>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> is compiled with GNU make, which we call gmake in the
following. Note that on some systems, GNU make is called make.
Most other implementations of make won't work.</p>

<pre>
   gmake [FLAGS="some flags"] [IMDSYS="some system"] potfit-target
</pre>

<p>
The compiler and compilation flags are determined according to the 
<a href="compiling.html#imdsys">IMDSYS variable</a>, which must be set
either as an environment variable, or be passed on the command line as
above. The usage of the IMDSYS variable, as first introduced in the
<a href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd">IMD</a> program
is much more flexible than the just the HOSTTYPE environment variable,
as it allows specific optimization and link flags for a wide variety
of processors and compiler combinations.  Further compile or link
flags, in addition to those determined by the IMDSYS variable, can be
passed on the command line with the help of the FLAGS variable.</p>

<p>
After compiling, the <em>potfit</em> executable is moved to the directory 
$HOME/bin/$HOSTTYPE, which must exist, and which should be in the 
search path. The location where executables are put can be customized 
in the Makefile. </p>

<p>
<tt>potfit-target</tt> consists of several components and has the
following structure:</p>

<pre>
   potfit[_parallelization][_option][_option]...
</pre>

<p>
Most features of <em>potfit</em> must be activated with the corresponding 
compilation option in the make target. In particular, you need to 
enable the support 
for different interactions, if you don't want to use tabulated 
pair potentials. Most options can coexist with each other. 
</p>

<h2>Compilation Options</h2>

<p>
Most compilation options are described together with the simulation
features they enable. For details, see the corresponding chapters.
Here, we only list some general options.</p>

<h3>Parallelization options</h3>

<p>  
<em>potfit</em> can be compiled with the following parallelization options.
If none of these is specified, a serial executable is compiled.
</p>

<table summary="supported parallalization options">
<tr><td>mpi        </td> <td>parallelization with MPI            </td></tr>
<tr><td>omp        </td> <td>parallelization with OpenMP         </td></tr>
<tr><td>ompi&nbsp; </td> <td>parallelization with MPI and OpenMP </td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<table summary="supported compilation options">
<!-- <tr><td>apot	     </td><td>Use analytic potentials.</td></tr> -->
<tr><td>eam          </td><td>Use Embedded Atom Potentials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>stress       </td><td>Include stress in fit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>parab        </td><td>Use parabolic interpolation for
embedding function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>debug        </td><td>Compile with debug support.</td></tr>
<tr><td>noresc       </td><td>Do NOT rescale the potential if
necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fweight      </td><td>Weigh the contribution of the forces.
according to their magnitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td>dist         </td><td>Create distribution file, incompatible
with mpi parallelization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>newscale     </td><td>Create rescaled IMD and plotfiles, incompatible
with mpi parallelization.</td></tr>
</table>

<p> Note: The limit compiling options available in earlier versions
has been removed. Using the limitation constraint for the embedding
density is now mandatory and not optional any more. </p>

<h2>Supported values of the IMDSYS variable</h2>


<p>
Currently, the following values of the IMDSYS variable are supported
(though only the AthlonMP and P4 has been thoroughly tested, most have not
been tested at all):</p>

<table summary="supported IMDSYS values">
<tr><td>AthlonMP-icc  </td><td> Athlon MP or XP, icc                 </td></tr>
<tr><td>AthlonMP-gcc3 </td><td> Athlon MP or XP, gcc3                </td></tr>
<tr><td>P4-icc        </td><td> Pentium 4 or Xeon, icc               </td></tr>
<tr><td>P4-gcc3       </td><td> Pentium 4 or Xeon, gcc3              </td></tr>
<tr><td>P3-icc        </td><td> Pentium II/III, icc                  </td></tr>
<tr><td>P3-gcc3       </td><td> Pentium II/III, gcc3                 </td></tr>
<tr><td>ia32-gcc2     </td><td> generic IA32, gcc2 (very slow)       </td></tr>
<tr><td>ia64-ecc      </td><td> Intel Itanium 2, ecc                 </td></tr>
<tr><td>alpha-cc      </td><td> Alpha EV56, cc                       </td></tr>
<tr><td>alpha-gcc2    </td><td> Alpha EV56, gcc2 (slow)              </td></tr>
<tr><td>irix-cc       </td><td> Irix, mips3, cc                      </td></tr>
<tr><td>irix-gcc2     </td><td> Irix, mips3, gcc2 (slow)             </td></tr>
<tr><td>USparc3-cc    </td><td> UltraSparc3, cc                      </td></tr>
<tr><td>sparc-gcc2    </td><td> generic sparc, gcc2 (slow)           </td></tr>
<tr><td>T3E-cc        </td><td> Cray T3E, cc                         </td></tr>
<tr><td>sr8k-cc       </td><td> HITACHI SR8000, cc                   </td></tr>
<tr><td>sr8k-xcc      </td><td> xcc cross compiler for HITACHI SR8000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power4-cc     </td><td> IBM Power4, cc </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The GCC 2.x compilers should usually be avoided. Especially on the IA32
architecture, they produce very slow code. GCC 3.2 or the Intel compiler
icc are much better choices. </p>

<p>
Support for further values of IMDSYS is easily added. The Makefile
contains a detailed decsription of how the compile and link flags
are determined from a number of Makefile variables, which must be
set for each supported value of IMDSYS. There is a template from
which one can start. </p>
