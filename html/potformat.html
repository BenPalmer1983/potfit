<h1>Potential File Format</h1>

<p>
The interactions supported by <em>potfit</em> are defined in terms of
tabulated functions. Typical such functions are central pair
potentials, which depend on the distance of two atoms and the two atom
types involved. Such functions are tabulated with steps which are
equidistant in the <b>distance</b>, which is the fundamental
difference to <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a>, where
those functions are tabulated with steps equidistant in the square of
the distance. For EAM interactions one also needs functions which
depend on one atom type and the host electron density at the position
of that atom. Such functions are tabulated with steps equidistant in
the electron density.</p>

<h2>Potential File Header</h2>

<p>
The header is comparable to headers in <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a>. It
specifies in which format the current file is, and how many data
columns the tabulated function has for each argument. The number
of data columns depends on the potential model used.
The header has the
following format:</p>

<pre>
## this is just a comment line
#F 3 n
#I 0 1 .... n entries (this line is optional)
#G 2 3 .... n entries (this line is optional)
## this is another comment line
#E this is the very last header line
</pre>

<p>
Header lines start with the character '#'. If the second character is
'F', then the format specifier 3 (to distinguish from IMD potential
files, format types 1 or 2) and the number n of 
data columns of the tabulated functions are read from the rest of the 
line. The very last header line must have a character 'E' at the 
second position. Header lines with a second character different from 
'F', 'E' or 'G' are treated as comments, but it is recommended that such 
lines start with two '#' characters. </p>

<p> The line I defines whether a whole potential function should be kept
constant during a force matching run. Each digit corresponds to one function
table, so there should be n digits in total. A value of '0' allows
<em>potfit</em> to change the corresponding potential function, a value of '1'
keeps it fixed. This is useful for example if a third component is to be added
to a binary system and only the additional potentials are to be allowed to
change. </p>

<p> The line G specifies whether the gradient of the interpolation
splines should be treated as fixed or as an additional degree of
freedom. Each digit corresponds to one function table, so there should
be n digits in total. The information is bit-coded, '0' declares both
lower and upper gradient fixed, '1' allows adjusting the gradient at
the upper end, '2' at the lower end, and '3' at both ends. </p>

<h2>Format 3</h2>

<p>
In a potential file in format 3, each data column has its own range
and spacing. Sampling points are equidistant in the atomic distance r
or (when using EAM-type interactions) electron density n.
If we have n data columns, the file starts with n lines
of the form
<pre>
x_begin x_end steps
</pre>
specifying the start, end, and the number of function values in each
data set.  n data columns. The argument x is either the atom distance,
or the host electron density. These n lines are then followed by n
blocks with the function values, one for each atom type pair or atom
type. The spacing of function values is computed from the begin, end,
and number of function values of the corresponding table and can be
different for the different data columns.</p> 

<p>The data sets for N atom types have to be arranged as follows:
<pre>
V_00 V_01 ... V_0N V_11 ... V_1N ... V_NN  (pair interaction)
rho_0 rho_1 ... rho_N  (EAM electron transfer)
U_0 U_1 ... U_N        (EAM embedding energy)
</pre>

<p> If the 'G' header line is specified, each data block must be
preceded by two values specifying the gradient of the function at the
lower and upper boundaries. A value of 10^30 or higher triggers the usage
of natural splines (curvature 0 at boundaries). <em>You should not
make the gradient variable at boundaries where natural splines are
specified. This will lead to undesired results.</em></p>

<p> A sample format 3 potential file for a binary system for an EAM
potential is available <a href="sample3g.pt.txt">with</a> or <a
href="sample3.pt.txt">without</a> the #G header line.


<p><b>Please note:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The pair potential matrix V_ij is implicitly symmetric, and only the
upper triangle of this matrix is given. </li>
<li> The transfer function rho_i depends on the type of the donating
atom only. </li>
<li> The embedding function U_i depends on the type of the accepting
(embedded) atom only.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Format 4</h2>
<p>As with potential files in format 3 each data column has its own
spacing. But with potential format 4 the requirement that the sampling
points be equidistant is dropped. Arbitrarily spaced sampling points
are possible, but the sampling points have to be given in order.</p>

<p>Preceding the data columns is a header with one line per column,
containing the number of sampling points in the corresponding
column. Seperated by blank lines then the data columns follow. Each of
the columns has the form
<pre>
r_0     f(r_0)
r_1     f(r_1)
...
r_steps f(r_steps)
</pre>
Please note that r<sub>0</sub> < r<sub>1</sub> < ... < r<sub>steps</sub> is
required. 
The order of the columns is the same as with format 3. </p>

<p> A sample format 4 potential file for a binary system (EAM
potential) is available <a href="sample4g.pt.txt">here</a> (with the
#G header line).</p>
