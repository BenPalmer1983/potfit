<h1>Developer's Corner</h1>

<p>
Here we give some hints on how to extend <em>potfit</em>. In
particular, we list some common pitfalls that are to be avoided.</p>

<h2>Introducing new parameters</h2>

<p>
Before a new parameter can be used, it must be</p>
<ul>
<li>declared and initialized to default value (in file potfit.h)</li>
<li>read into <em>potfit</em> (routine getparamfile() in file param.c)</li>
<li>possibly checked for nonsense values (routine
    check_parameters_complete() in file param.c)</li>
<li>broadcast to the other CPUs (routine broadcast_params() in
    file mpi_utils.c)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Revision control system: CVS</h2>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> is maintained with the revision control system CVS. It is
desirable to include the following lines of comment at the 
beginning of each new source code file:</p>

<pre>
/****************************************************************
* $Revision: 1.2 $
* $Date: 2005/07/20 15:38:13 $
*****************************************************************/
</pre>

<p>
CVS replaces these lines automatically with the correct
version number and date, if the new file is checked into the CVS 
repository.</p>

<h2>Naming conventions for files</h2>

<ul>
<li> Source files are all named with lower case letters</li>
<li> Non-source files in the source directory begin with a capital letter
     (e.g. Makefile, README, INSTALL)</li>
<li> Documentation should be written, in English and in HTML.</li>
</ul>
