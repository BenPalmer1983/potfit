CVS Version 20081126

+ Added an awk script to convert apot potentials to gnuplot format
+ A new validate function to check the generated potentials has
  been implemented
+ Removed precomputed power-tables
+ Completely rewritten the smooth-cutoff option (now beta stage)
+ imdpot is now optional and no longer mandatory
+ New parameter "plotmin", the plotting potential and imd potential will
  begin at this point (works only for APOT)
