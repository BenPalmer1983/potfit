<h1>Interactions</h1>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> supports various short range
effective potentials. These potentials are defined either by tabulated
functions or analytic parameters and are read from a <a href="potformat.html">potential file</a>.
The potentials supported are <a href="pairpot.html">central pair
potentials</a>, and
<a href="eam2.html">Embedded Atom Method (EAM)</a> potentials for 
metals.
</p>

<p>
Since the computation of the forces is the most time-critical part
of a molecular dynamics simulation, support for each type of
interaction has to be enabled explicitly by a compilation option.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The modified embedded atom method has been implemented by Sergey Starikov and Vladimir Stegailov from the Joint Institute for High Temperatures RAS in Moscow. Some features are still missing and the testing has not been completed yet.</li>
	<li>Angular dependant potentials are currently implemented and should be ready quite soon.</li>
	<li>The work on implementing dipole-dipole interaction in potfit has recently been started.
</ol>
