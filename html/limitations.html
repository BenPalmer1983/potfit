<h1>Limitations of the current implemetation</h1>
<h2>Spline Interpolation</h2>
<p>
At the moment, <em>potfit</em> takes its potential functions through values at
sampling points and spline interpolation in between. While this allows
considerable flexibility, it also has some disadvantages. Especially for
distance ranges with rapid changes in function values, the spline polynomials
might produce overswings. Users need to keep an eye on the interpolated
functions to check if they suffer from potential artefacts.
</p>
<p>
It is planned to implement different potential specifications, including
potentials given by a functional expression, expansions in orthonormal
functions or superpositions of elementary building blocks
(e.g. Gaussians). These functions might be less prone to oscillations.
</p>

<h2>Transferability</h2>
<p>Force-matched potentials only know what they
were trained to. If possible, all local environments that might occur in
simulations should also be present in the set of reference configurations.
Otherwise the results may not be reliable. Giving up some transferability
may lead to higher precision in certain situations, however: By carefully
constraining the variety of reference structures (and thus reducing the
contradictions in the reference data) one may generate a potential that
is much more precise in one specific situation than a general purpose
potential, which was trained on a broader set of referenece structures.
The latter potential, on the other hand, will be more versatile, but less
accurate on average.</p>

<h2>Suitable reference structures</h2><p> As mentioned above, all
possible local environments should be included in the reference structures. 
This might be a problem in some systems, if there are not many periodic
structures approximating a complex phase. It should be kept in mind that to
generate a potential that can describe the interaction between two atoms at
every interatomic distance between inner and outer cutoff, r<sub>min</sub>
and r<sub>cut</sub>, all those distances need to appear also in the set
of reference structures. If changing one of the parameters of the potential
functions does not effect any of the calculated forces, then force
matching will of course not yield any information on the value of this
parameter.</p>
<h2>Number of species</h2> <p>The complexity of determining an effective
potential increases in two ways with the number of species in the systems:
Firstly, the number of parameters to adjust usually grows faster than linear,
and secondly, it gets more and more difficult to provide all required
interatomic distances between the various atom species. This is especially
true when one of the atom types is a minority constituent. Here, it might
help to fix the interaction between certain species during minimization or
ensure that they are always far enough apart to not interact. Another
solution is using nonlocal functions like a superposition of broad
gaussians or an analytic function. Changing one parameter can then affect
the function over a broad range of arguments, making it again possible
to fit a function on which only sparse information is provided in the
reference data.</p>

<h2>Experimental values as reference data</h2>
<p><em>potfit</em> does not use experimental data during force matching, the
potentials are adapted exclusively to ab-initio data, which means they
cannot exceed the first principles calculations in physical correctness.
While in principle implementing the comparison to experimental values is
straightforward, we decided against such an addition. For once, in
quasicrystals there are no experimental values that can be calculated directly
from the potentials, so determining them would considerably slow down the
target function  evaluation. Secondly, most of the
experimental values depend on the exact structure of the system, which in most
cases is not known beforehand due to fractional occupancies in the structure
model. A better way to use experimental data is to test whether the newly
generated potentials lead to structures that under MD simulation show the
behavior known from experiment.</p>
