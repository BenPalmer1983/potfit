<h1>Central Pair Potentials</h1>

<p>
Short range pair potentials are active by default in <em>potfit</em>.
</p>

<p>
Pair potentials are given in <a href="pairpot.html#pottab">
tabulated form</a>
</p>

<h2><a id="pottab" name="pottab">
Tabulated Pair Potentials</a></h2>

<p>
For use in <em>potfit</em>, any potential needs to be specified at a
limited number of sampling points. Position and value of these
sampling points are given in the file specified with the parameter
<tt>potfile</tt>. The format used in this file is described <a
href="potformat.html">above</a>.  It is essential that the potential
is tabulated equidistant in the the atom distance, not in the sqare
(as it is done in <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a>).  Note
that if the potential does not extend to radii small enough to cover
all pair distances appearing in the configurations, the program will
exit with an short distance error. </p>
