CVS-20081201
+ new_slots should now be a lot faster as we only update if there actually
  is a new parameter or a new cutoff radius
+ Improved awk script to read an arbitrary number of potential files
+ some minor tweaks in the SA-algorithm, mainly for speed purposes
+ fixed bug with temporary potential files, now the current potential
  and not the past one is written to the tempfile
+ new variable real *calc_list that stores the parameters with which
  the potential in the calc_table was generated from

CVS-20081126
+ Added an awk script to convert apot potentials to gnuplot format
+ A new validate function to check the generated potentials has
  been implemented
+ Removed precomputed power-tables
+ Completely rewritten the smooth-cutoff option (now beta stage)
+ imdpot is now optional and no longer mandatory
+ New parameter "plotmin", the plotting potential and imd potential will
  begin at this point (works only for APOT)
