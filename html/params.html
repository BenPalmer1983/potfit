<h1>Valid Parameters</h1>

<p>
Following is a complete list of <em>potfit</em> parameters, together
with a short description of their meaning, and indications when they
are needed.  Floating point numbers should be given in decimal
notation. Vectors are given as a list of components, separated by
spaces or tabs (all on one line). An asterik marks required parameters</p>

<pre>
# main parameters
ntypes		# number of atom types (types vary in [0..ntypes-1]) (*)

# file names - required
config		# file with atom configuration in force format (*)
startpot	# file name for starting potential (*)
endpot		# file name for final potential (*)
tempfile	# file name for temporary (intermediate) potential (*)

# file names - optional
imdpot		# file name prefix for imd potential 
plotfile	# file name for plotting potential
flagfile	# file whose presence terminates fit

# general options
write_pair 	# binary, radial pair distribution, will be written to config.pair

# options only for tabulated potentials
plotpointfile	# file name for plotting the sampling points (*)
distfile	# file name for distribution file (* with compile
		# option 'dist')
maxchfile	# file with maximal permissible changes for each parameter

# options only for analytic potentials
plotmin 	# starting point for plotting potentials
enable_cp 	# binary, whether or not to include chemical potentials

# options for output
imdpotsteps 	# number of points in each function in imd file
output_prefix  	# prefix for various output files like force, energy and stress
 		# deviations

# Minimization options
opt		# binary, whether or not to perform an optimization.
anneal_temp	# starting temperature for simulated annealing. 
		# set to zero to skip simulated annealing
evo_width 	# width of the normal distribution used to initialize the
		# the starting population for evolutionary algorithm
		# set to zero to skip evo
d_eps 		# error margin for powell minimization
		# if improvement is smaller, optimization is stopped
eng_weight	# weight of energy in minimization
stress_weight	# weight of stress in minimiziation
seed            # seed for random number generator


# Deprecated options (used in earlier versions)
dummy_rho 	# dummy value of rho at dummy_r, now ignored
dummy_r		# Distance, where dummy_rho and dummy_phi are used (ignored)
dummy_phi	# vector (length ntypes) dummy values of phi_ii at dummy_r
