<h1>Units</h1>

<p>
<em>potfit</em> does not need a particular system of units. It can
work with any system. The units used by <em>potfit</em> are implicitly
defined in the configuration and potential files, and possibly by
certain parameters specifying the potential. The reference
configuration file contains atom positions, which implicitly defines a
length unit. The interaction potential implicitly makes use of a
length unit and an energy unit. Of course, this length unit must be
the same as for the configuration file. The two units of length, and
energy determine other units - like force and pressure - which are
derived from them.  The &laquo;temperature&raquo; in simulated
annealing has the same dimension as the sum of squares - none at
all.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
If the length unit is 1&nbsp;&Aring; = 1e-10&nbsp;m, and the energy
unit is 1&nbsp;eV = 1.602e-19&nbsp;J (which corresponds to 11594&nbsp;K),
then the unit of pressure is 160.2&nbsp;GPa = 1602&nbsp;kbar, and the
unit of force is 1&nbsp;eV/&Aring; = 1.602e-9&nbsp;N = 1.602&nbsp;nN</p>
