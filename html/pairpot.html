<h1>Central Pair Potentials</h1>

<p>
Short range pair potentials can be activated in <em>potfit</em> with the compile target PAIR.
</p>

<p>
Pair potentials can be given in <a href="pairpot.html#pottab">
tabulated form</a> or with analytic parameters.
</p>

<h2><a id="pottab" name="pottab">
Tabulated Pair Potentials</a></h2>

<p>
For use in <em>potfit</em>, any potential needs to be specified at a
limited number of sampling points. Position and value of these
sampling points are given in the file specified with the parameter
<tt>potfile</tt>. The format used in this file is described <a
href="potformat.html">above</a>.  It is essential that the potential
is tabulated equidistant in the the atom distance, not in the sqare
(as it is done in <a
href="http://www.itap.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/~imd/">IMD</a>).  Note
that if the potential does not extend to radii small enough to cover
all pair distances appearing in the configurations, the program will
exit with an short distance error. </p>

<h2><a id="pottab" name="pottab">
Analytic Pair Potentials</a></h2>

<p>
In order to use analytic potentials in <em>potfit</em>, you have to specify the functions
and the values of the parameters in the potential file. 
The format used in this file is described <a href="potformat.html">above</a>.<br />
With analytic potentials there is also the option to add an additional energy term to the fit, the so called chemical potential.
</p>

<h3><a id="chempot" name="chempot">
Chemical Potentials</a></h3>
<p>
For fitting simple pair potentials the use of the chemical potentials will always be
disabled unless the <b>enable_cp</b> switch in the configuration file is set to 1.<br />
This option effectively adds another energy term into the calculations, the energy
will be calculated as <br /><img src="chempot.png" alt="E_tot=\sum_{species}\mu_iN_i+\sum_{pairs}V(r)" /><br />
With this feature enabled, the potential file has to be altered, an additional block
has to be added right after the header.</p>
<pre>
#F 0 3
#C Mg Zn
#I 0 0 0
#E

cp_Mg -1 -10 0
cp_Zn -1 -10 0
</pre>
<p>There has to be one line per element, starting with cp_, the rest of the name 
will be replaced by the element name (if the #C line is available) or the element number.<br />
The following three values are the starting value, the minimum and maximum for that parameter.<br />
<br />
This feature is only available for simple pair potentials.
